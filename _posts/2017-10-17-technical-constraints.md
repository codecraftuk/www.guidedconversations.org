<ul>
<li>What are the biggest technical constraints you face in your development?</li>
<li>What would the consequences be of getting these trade-offs wrong?</li>
<li>How do these impact the way you would prefer to work, if you had more freedom?</li>
<li>How do you explain to new team members how the code is affected by these constraints?</li>
<li>What do you feel OK about compromising on?</li>
<li>What compromise would you go to great lengths to avoid making?</li>
<li>Do the trade-offs affect the quality of your product from a user’s perspective, or is their impact more internal?</li>
<li>What can you do to mitigate the effects of these compromises?</li>
<li>How do you stop compromise becoming a habit?</li>
<li>How do you know if your constraints are absolute or negotiable?</li>
<li>How do challenging constraints improve you as a developer?</li>

</ul>
