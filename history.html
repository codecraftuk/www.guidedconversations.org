<h2>The History</h2>

<p>
    <a href="https://twitter.com/joe_jag">Joe Wright</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/garyfleming">Gary Fleming</a> came up with a variant of <a href="http://leancoffee.org/">LeanCoffee</a> that allowed for a focused, yet structured, meeting which was called “Guided Conversations”.
</p>

<p>
    The original drive came from the agile prinicple of "More value for less effort".
    If you can get a group of practictioners together, how can you elict their collective wisdom on a topic without using a presentation format?
    Cracking this problem would allow for quick to prepare meetups with a high reward for the attendees.
</p>

<p>
    The very first Guided Conversation was in June 2014 in Glasgow for <a href="http://www.codecraftuk.org/">CodeCraft</a>.
    It focusing on breaking down a new software architectural style called Microservices into a series of questions that gave everyone in the group a chance to share their story.
</p>

<p>
    The success of this format led to a conference being created with GuidedConversations as the dominant form of session in 2015.
</p>

<p>
    The conference and meetup popularised the format which has led to people using GuidedConversations in their own companies and meetups.
