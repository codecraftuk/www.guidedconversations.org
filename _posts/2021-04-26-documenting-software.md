* The Agile Manifesto says: "We have come to value ... Working software over comprehensive documentation … That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.“ So what value have you found recently in software documentation?
* Some people state that code should be self documenting. Which subjects can you think of that might need more documentation than code alone and why?
* How do you document software architecture? And which aspects of it?
* When and how do you produce API documentation?
* Under which conditions do you consider tests as documentation?
* Where do you store documentation?
* How do you make it easy to find and access documentation?
* What is the role of vcs commit messages for documentation purposes?
* How do you keep your documentation up to date?
* When is it worth to guarantee or check automatically that software and its documentation are in sync - sometimes referred to as "Living Documentation"?
* Which types of documentation should be considered an output artifact in its own right?
